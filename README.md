# SeqVista-Sequence-to-Sequence-Model-for-Vision-Language-Navigation
The SeqVista project focuses on developing a Seq2Seq model for Vision-Language Navigation (VLN), training an autonomous agent to understand and execute natural language instructions in unseen environments using the Matterport 3D simulator and Room-to-Room dataset. This integrates advanced NLP and computer vision techniques.
